                  Thinking about adding a second cat to the family? This
                  essential guide on managing multi-cat households will answer
                  all your questions and maybe even prevent a kitty
                  apocalypse—now in an expanded and updated edition. America's
                  favorite cat expert and award-winning author shows how adding
                  another cat to your home does not have to be the start of a
                  cat vs. cat war zone. Although cats are often misunderstood as
                  natural loners, you can readily introduce new members to your
                  family, and keep the fur from flying. Johnson-Bennett shows
                  how to plan, set up, and maintain a home environment that will
                  help multiple cats--and their owners--live in peace. Cat vs.
                  Cat will help readers understand the importance of territory,
                  the specialized communication cats use to establish
                  relationships and hierarchies, and how to interpret the
                  so-called "bad behavior" that leads so many owners to needless
                  frustration. Offering a wealth of information on how to
                  diffuse tension, prevent squabbles and ambushes, blend two
                  families, or help the elder kitty in your family, Cat vs. Cat
                  is a welcome resource for both seasoned and prospective
                  guardians of cat families large and small. Thinking about
